# Impulse Gate

> An Android accessibility service that drops a full-screen wall in front of apps chosen for gating and keeps them hidden until the phrase `i want this` is typed by hand.

**[Download the APK (v1.0)](https://github.com/lambdaf-org/impulse-gate/releases/latest)** (~620 KB, Android 8.0+)

Your phone is full of apps engineered by very smart people whose paycheck depends on
you opening them. Willpower does nothing against a feed tuned by ten thousand A/B
tests. So stop fighting fair.

A tiny Android app (~600 KB, zero dependencies) that puts a wall between you and your
impulses. You pick which apps to gate; from then on, opening one of them shows a
fully opaque full-screen overlay **before you can see anything**, and the app stays
hidden until you type:

```
i want this
```

Leaving the app re-arms the gate, so the next open asks for the phrase again. Transient
windows like the keyboard or a permission dialog do not re-lock the session.

Verified end-to-end on an Android 15 emulator, from the opaque gate through phrase
unlock and re-lock on leave.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lambdaf-org/impulse-gate
cd impulse-gate
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Building requires JDK 17 and the Android SDK (platform 35). The APK lands at
`app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`, debug-signed so it sideloads directly.

Install it with adb:

```bash
$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

Then open the app, tick the apps to gate, tap ENABLE, and turn on the service under
Accessibility settings.

> **Android 13+ note:** if the APK was installed from a file manager or browser rather
> than adb, Android blocks the accessibility toggle for sideloaded apps. Go to
> *Settings, Apps, Impulse Gate, top-right menu, Allow restricted settings*, then enable
> the service. Installing via `adb install` avoids this.

## Features

- **Phrase gate**: a gated app opens behind an opaque full-screen overlay, hidden until the exact phrase `i want this` is typed (whitespace and case are normalized).
- **Typed entry, paste blocked**: the input field blocks autofill and the long-press menu, and a clipboard-sized text jump (8 or more inserted characters) gets wiped, so the phrase has to be typed by hand.
- **Per-app, per-visit unlock**: typing the phrase unlocks that one app until the user leaves it. Each gated app is tracked separately, and leaving re-arms the gate.
- **No screen reading**: the service declares `canRetrieveWindowContent="false"` and reads nothing from the screen. It only listens for window-state changes.
- **No overlay permission**: it draws a `TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY` window, which an accessibility service may add without the "draw over other apps" grant.
- **Zero dependencies**: the whole app is two Kotlin files building Views in code, with no third-party libraries.

## How it works

One `AccessibilityService` listens for `TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED` events. When a gated
package reaches the foreground, it attaches an opaque, full-screen overlay window with no
animation, so nothing of the app shows through. The Back button is swallowed inside the
overlay, and Home stays as the way out. A transient system window (permission dialog, share
sheet, volume panel) over a gated app is not treated as leaving, so the unlock survives
it. Going to the home screen, the recents view, or another launchable app re-arms the gate.

The overlay is rebuilt on rotation and on fold or unfold, and the service swallows its own
exceptions so a single failure cannot get it disabled by the system. If an aggressive OEM
battery manager force-kills the service while a gated app is open, the gate drops until
the system re-binds the service and re-fires the window event, which on stock Android
self-restores in about a second.

The chosen apps are stored in `SharedPreferences`. There are no environment variables or
config files to set.

## Notes and known limits

- The overlay appears the moment the system reports the window change, which is effectively instant, though a sub-100 ms flash of the app is inherent to the accessibility approach on some devices.
- The recents screen shows the gated app's real thumbnail, because Android snapshots the app's own surfaces and an external overlay cannot be part of that snapshot.
- This is self-discipline software. The service can always be disabled or the app uninstalled. The gate only needs to make opening an app a conscious act.
